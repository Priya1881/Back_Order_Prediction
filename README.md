# Back_Order_Prediction
The objective of this system is to build a classification model which will be able to predict whether an order for a given product can go on backorder or not.
A backorder is the order which could not be fulfilled by the company. Due to high demand of a product, the company was not able to keep up with the delivery of the order.

- Performed Data Ingestion,Data preprocessing ,Data validation, and Data visualisation for better insights.
- Created Clusters using clustering technique.
- Build predictive model using ML algorithms.
- Applied Hyperparameter tuning techniques  for better performance and accuracy.
- Generating logs for better introspection of the project.
- Deployed the model onto Heroku web services platform.
